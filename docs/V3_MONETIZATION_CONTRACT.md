# V3 Monetization Contract — TokToTable

## Purpose
This document defines the **monetization rules** for TokToTable V3.
It is a **hard contract** between product, engineering, and business.

Extract stability is non-negotiable.
Anything that costs money must be gated.

## Plans

### Free
- Max **5 recipe extracts per week**
- Local-only usage

### Pro (€19 / month)
- **200 recipe extracts per month**
- AI enhancements included
- Image handling included
- Cloud sync & backup (coming)

- Priority stability

---

## Core Principles
- Everything that incurs variable cost is **Pro-only**
- Limits are enforced **server-side**

## Technical Rules
