# TokToTable – Documentation Overview

This folder contains all non-code documentation for the TokToTable project.

The goal is to keep **context, decisions, and intent** close to the code, without cluttering the root of the repository.

  `product/VISION.md`

## History & decisions

- **V1 recovery post-mortem**  
  `01-postmortem-v1-recovery.md`  
  Detailed analysis of the V1 incident, recovery, and lessons learned.

## Marketing

- **Landing page copy**  
  `marketing/LANDING_COPY.md`

## How to use this documentation

- Treat these documents as **living context**, not static specs
- Update them when decisions are made, not after problems occur
- Prefer clarity over completeness

---

## Rules going forward

- `main` remains production-only
- Experimental work belongs in branches
- Major decisions should be reflected in docs
